# MNIST Neural Networks

In this project, I used a MNIST-Handwritten digit data to train Neural Network Parameters of a Network with only 1 hidden layer. The data has 5000 training examples, each training example is a 20 pixel by 20 pixel grayscale image of the digit. Our Input Layer has 400 units, the hidden layer has 25 units and the output layer has 10 units (Each representing one number out of 0 to 9). We achieve an Accuracy of 99.72%.
